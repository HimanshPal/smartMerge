Ideas:
Probably Dynastore currently performs better, because the servers order Next to the configurations in which it was written.

Now we send the id of the currently used blueprint in AReadS and AWriteS, instead of the ID of the current blueprint. This might cause additional accesses. DONE

DynaStore: The original Dynastore algorithm aborts traverse, whenever it finds a new current configuration. Should we implement this.
